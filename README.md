# Group_P_Labor_Market

Hi, We are group P. Our topic is labor maket.

# Intro 
The recent minimum bill proposal raised by the democrats shows their goal to increase minimum wage to $15 per hour by 2025. Inspired by this ambitious bill, we decide to make visualizations of the labor market data. In specific, we would like to explore the minimum wage and unemployment rate of each state of U.S.  Hopefully, our map will enable small business owners, workers, and policy researchers to learn about the labor market statistics.
